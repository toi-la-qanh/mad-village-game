Here is the description of the game: The game will keep the basic structure of the classic `Werewolf` game but with an important change in the characteristics of the villagers. Instead of having only one group of villagers, I divided them into two types: good villagers and crazy villagers. Good villagers, who are the positive side, can perform special skills. Bad villagers, who are the werewolves representing the negative side, will be able to perform more skills than villagers. Crazy villagers, who are also positive but their skills will not be effective. The game structure will be divided into the following stages: Night stage: In this stage, players will choose a target to perform their actions. Day Phase: The results of the actions during the night will be reported to all players. Discussion Phase: Players will be allowed to chat and discuss the events that happened during the night, finding out who the bad villagers are. Voting Phase: Players will vote for who they think is the bad person, and the person with the most votes will be hanged. The game ends when one of the following conditions is met: The number of villagers is less than or equal to the number of werewolves; There are no more werewolves in the game."
