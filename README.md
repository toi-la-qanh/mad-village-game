### Game Instruction

This game is based on the classic "Werewolf" game, but with some key differences. The basic structure still involves two main groups: the **villagers** and the **werewolves**. However, the **villagers** are further divided into two traits: _good_ and _mad_. The _good_ villagers are those who can perform actions during the game, while the _mad_ villagers are unable to take any actions.

The **werewolves**, representing the _bad_ traits, have the ability to perform more actions than the villagers. The gameplay is divided into several phases, each with specific actions:

- The Night Phase: During this phase, players choose the targets and perform actions.
- The Day Phase: Reported the results of the actions taken in the night phase.
- The Discussion Phase: Players are allowed to chat with each other, discuss the events of the night and try to figure out who the werewolves are.
- The Vote Phase: Players then vote on who they believe should be hanged. The player with the most votes is eliminated from the game.

The game will _end_ when one of the following conditions is met:

- The number of villagers is less than or equal to the number of werewolves.
- There are no werewolves left in the game.
